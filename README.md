# One more data analysis about coronavirus, but normalized...

## Introduction
I coded this in order to follow figures about covid, for curiosity, without any goal else.

It would be very useful and interesting to know :
* the number of tests in each country (maybe the confirmed rate is underestimated) ;
* the fiability of figures of death (countries may hide some death).

I am not a data scientist, thanks for any tip you can give me to improve this code.

Take care,

Yann Marsaud
